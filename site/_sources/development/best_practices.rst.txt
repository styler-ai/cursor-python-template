Working with the Template
-------------------------

This section outlines best practices for working with the Cursor Python Template to get the most out of its features.

Development Workflow
--------------------

Using Cursor Effectively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To leverage the power of Cursor's AI with this template:

1. **Ask the AI for help**: Cursor's AI is aware of the project structure and rules - ask it questions about implementation approaches, code organization, or best practices.

2. **Reference rules explicitly**: When asking the AI for help, you can explicitly mention rule files:
   
   * "Following the Python rules, how should I handle exceptions in this function?"
   * "Based on the core rules, which design pattern would be appropriate here?"
   * "According to the testing rules, how should I test this component?"

3. **Let the AI help with boilerplate**: Use the AI to generate repetitive code patterns that follow the template's rules.

4. **Request rule-compliant reviews**: Ask the AI to review your code for compliance with the rule files.

Project Organization
--------------------

Following the Template Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Keep the directory structure clean**:
   
   * Place all Python package code in ``src/your_package/``
   * Put all tests in ``tests/`` with similar structure to your package
   * Keep documentation in ``docs/``
   * Use ``scripts/`` for utility scripts and tools

2. **Use proper packaging**:
   
   * Maintain ``pyproject.toml`` as the central configuration
   * Define dependencies properly in ``pyproject.toml``
   * Use ``__init__.py`` files appropriately

3. **Maintain separation of concerns**:
   
   * Keep UI separate from business logic
   * Separate data access from processing
   * Place utilities in appropriate modules

Code Quality
------------

Maintaining High-Quality Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Follow language-specific rules**:
   
   * Python code should follow the guidelines in ``python-rules.mdc``
   * PowerShell scripts should follow ``powershell-rules.mdc``

2. **Use consistent code formatting**:
   
   * Consider using Black for Python code formatting
   * Use consistent indentation and naming conventions
   * Follow the style guidelines in the rule files

3. **Write comprehensive tests**:
   
   * Follow ``testing-rules.mdc`` guidelines
   * Maintain high test coverage
   * Test both happy paths and edge cases
   * Use fixtures and parameterized tests when appropriate

Documentation Practices
-----------------------

Keeping Documentation Current
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Document as you code**:
   
   * Add docstrings to all public functions, classes, and methods
   * Keep README up-to-date with current project status
   * Update Sphinx documentation with new features

2. **Follow documentation standards**:
   
   * Use Google-style docstrings for Python code
   * Include type annotations
   * Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
   * Provide usage examples for complex functions

3. **Maintain living documentation**:
   
   * Update documentation when code changes
   * Remove outdated documentation
   * Keep examples current with the latest API

Version Control
---------------

Git Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Follow commit message guidelines**:
   
   * Use descriptive commit messages
   * Reference issue numbers when applicable
   * Follow the conventions in ``github-rules.mdc``

2. **Branch management**:
   
   * Use feature branches for new features
   * Use bugfix branches for bug fixes
   * Keep main/master branch stable
   * Delete branches after merging

3. **Pull request process**:
   
   * Create descriptive PR titles and descriptions
   * Reference issues being addressed
   * Request appropriate reviewers
   * Address review comments promptly

Project Management
------------------

Tracking Project Progress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Use GitHub issues effectively**:
   
   * Follow guidelines in ``github-issues-rules.mdc``
   * Create appropriate issue types (epics, stories, tasks)
   * Use labels to categorize issues
   * Maintain issue relationships

2. **Track progress in the project plan**:
   
   * Follow ``project-plan-management-rules.mdc``
   * Update status as tasks are completed
   * Document blockers and dependencies
   * Keep timelines current

3. **Regular reviews**:
   
   * Conduct code reviews for all changes
   * Review project plan regularly
   * Update documentation with each release
   * Refine rules based on project learnings

Getting Help
------------

When you encounter issues with the template:

1. **Consult the rules**: Check the relevant rule files in ``.cursor/rules/`` for guidance
2. **Ask Cursor AI**: The AI is familiar with the template and can help resolve issues
3. **Check project documentation**: This documentation may provide insights
4. **Contribute improvements**: If you find ways to improve the template, consider contributing back
