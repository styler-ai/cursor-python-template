Project Plan Management Rules
=============================

Guidelines for maintaining and working with project plans.

File: `project-plan-management-rules.mdc`

Purpose
-------

The Project Plan Management Rules establish a framework for creating, maintaining, and reporting on project plans. These rules ensure that project plans accurately reflect work to be done, guide development activities, and provide transparency for stakeholders.

Key Principles
--------------

* **Living Document**: Project plans evolve with the project
* **Single Source of Truth**: Authoritative reference for project status
* **Breakdown Structure**: Hierarchical organization of tasks
* **Realistic Scheduling**: Tasks have accurate time estimates
* **Clear Dependencies**: Task relationships are explicitly defined
* **Resource Allocation**: Appropriate assignment of responsibilities
* **Progress Tracking**: Regular status updates and metrics
