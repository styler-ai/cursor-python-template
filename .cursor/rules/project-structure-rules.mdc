# Project Structure Rules

## Directory Organization

### Root Level
- `/src/project_name_placeholder/` - Main package code
- `/tests/` - Test files
- `/docs/` - Documentation
- `/scripts/` - Development and setup scripts ONLY
- `/.project_data/` - Internal data ONLY (no scripts)
- Configuration files (setup.py, requirements.txt, etc.)

### Scripts Location
- ALL scripts must be in `/scripts/`
- NEVER put scripts in `.project_data/`
- `.project_data/` is for:
  - `db/` - SQLite database
  - `logs/` - Log files
  - NO OTHER DIRECTORIES ALLOWED

### Script Categories
Development scripts in `/scripts/`:
- Installation scripts
- Setup scripts
- Development utilities
- Build scripts
- Test runners

### .project_data Directory
Strict contents:
- `db/` - Database files only
- `logs/` - Log files only
- NO scripts directory
- NO other directories allowed

## File Organization
- Python package code goes in `src/project_name_placeholder/`
- Tests go in `tests/`
- Documentation in `docs/`
- Development scripts in `scripts/`
- Data files in `.project_data/db/` or `.project_data/logs/`

## Naming Conventions
- Python files: lowercase with underscores
- Scripts: descriptive names with appropriate extensions
- Test files: prefix with `test_`
- Log files: descriptive with date stamps
- Database files: clear purpose in filename
