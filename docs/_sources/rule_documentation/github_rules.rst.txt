GitHub Rules
=========================

Guidelines for GitHub repository management, branch strategies, and collaborative workflows.

File: `github-rules.mdc`

Purpose
-------

The GitHub Rules establish standards for repository management, branch strategies, pull requests, and other GitHub-specific workflows to ensure consistent and efficient collaboration.

Key Principles
--------------

* **Structured Workflows**: Clear processes for code changes
* **Branch Management**: Organized branch strategy
* **Collaborative Review**: Effective pull request process
* **Integration Control**: Protected main/master branches
* **Version Tracking**: Proper tagging and release flow
* **Automation Usage**: Leveraging GitHub Actions
