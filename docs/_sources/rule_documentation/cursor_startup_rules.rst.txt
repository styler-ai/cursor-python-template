Cursor Startup Rules
=========================

Rules for Cursor AI startup and initialization process.

File: `cursor-startup-rules.mdc`

Purpose
-------

The Cursor Startup Rules establish a standardized process for the Cursor AI's initialization when beginning work on a project. These rules ensure the AI thoroughly understands the project before assisting users, leading to more effective assistance.

Key Principles
--------------

* **Thorough Preparation**: Comprehensive review of project files and rules
* **Systematic Analysis**: Methodical examination of project structure and components
* **Verification Requirements**: Specific checkpoints before proceeding with assistance
* **Structured Communication**: Clear format for presenting understanding
* **Active Learning**: Initiative in seeking missing information

Detailed Contents
-----------------

Required Startup Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mandatory steps for initial project review:

* Rules review process for understanding project standards
* Project analysis to examine files and structure
* Project plan review to understand goals and status
* Verification of understanding before proceeding

Verification Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Checkpoints to ensure proper understanding:

* Project plan verification
* Core component relationship validation
* Test suite comprehension
* Documentation organization understanding
* Script utilities awareness
* Project phase identification
* Development guideline internalization

Response Format Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standardized format for communicating understanding:

* Project status section with phase, progress, and issues
* Core components section with relationships and status
* Development context section with tools and requirements

Re-run Triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Conditions requiring re-initialization:

* Branch switching
* Major project updates
* Outdated context
* Uncertain project state
* Significant code changes
* Development focus changes
* Environment changes
* Unexpected behavior

AI Assistant Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Behavioral standards for the AI:

* Active learning approach to unclear areas
* Context maintenance throughout session
* Efficient operation focused on relevant components
* Clear communication of understanding
* Error reporting and resolution
* Documentation of knowledge gaps

Error Handling Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Guidelines for managing errors during startup:

* File access error reporting and resolution
* Understanding gap identification and clarification
* Rule conflict resolution process
* Missing information documentation
* Context correction process

Documentation Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Standards for recording knowledge:

* Knowledge gap documentation
* Understanding updates and corrections
* Session tracking for continuity
* Decision documentation
* History maintenance

Rationale
---------

The cursor startup rules serve several essential purposes:

1. **Comprehensive Understanding**: Ensuring the AI understands the project before assisting
2. **Consistency**: Providing a standardized initialization process
3. **Quality Assistance**: Enabling more accurate and relevant assistance
4. **Efficiency**: Identifying key information quickly to provide better support
5. **Transparency**: Clearly communicating the AI's understanding to users

By following these cursor startup rules, the AI can provide more effective assistance that's properly informed by project context and requirements.
